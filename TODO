TODO
* fix support for flac/ape/mpc
* download cover art
* do smart namefixing (knowing artist/title parts) and allow combining
  namefix option with freedb get
* see if improvements can be made to discid generator
* searchfreedb: default to using tag info, then albumdir as search words
* improve outer namebinder approximation algorithms
* support "manual" tags (=namingmuse shouldn't touch it)
* support other sources for metainformation. musicbrainz is a highly relevant source.
* clean up discmatch module and strip it for cddb knowledge
* detect exact duplicate albums and warn user about it
* NEVER autoselect 1 when using search
* don't tag albums with 1 song since the probability is very high that
  they will match only a lot of incorrect albums
* trackorder means alphabetical order, make new function to order by track nr
* more ~/.namingmuse/ module hooks: preprocessing, postprocessing etc..
* manually enter freedb disc id
* manually specify sort order of tracks for freedb lookup
* manually specify namebinding
* warn about invalidating albums
* add option to disable filterBySongCount
* fix file renaming to comply with user supplied encoding
* check for large amount of files (playtime > max CD playtime) and warn that namingmuse is an album oriented tagger. go ahead anyway if force was given.
