TODO

* download cover art
* do smart namefixing (knowing artist/title parts) and allow combining
  namefix option with freedb get
* see if improvements can be made to discid generator
* searchfreedb: add option for selecting namebinder
* searchfreedb: default to using albumdir as search words
* improve outer namebinder approximation algorithms
* support "manual" tags (=namingmuse shouldn't touch it)
* support other sources for metainformation. musicbrainz is a highly relevant source.
